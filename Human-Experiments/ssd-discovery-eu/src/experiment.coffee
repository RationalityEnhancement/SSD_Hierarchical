                As we go through our lives we are often drawn to immediate pleasures and avoid doing things that are unpleasant. For instance, we watch a Youtube video because it promises immediate fun, but we put off filing our taxes because that feels difficult.

                As we go through our lives we are often drawn to immediate pleasures and avoid doing things that are unpleasant. For instance, we watch a Youtube video because it promises immediate fun, but we put off filing our taxes because that feels difficult.
